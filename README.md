# xml-tuto
This is an eXtreme MultiLabel Classification tutorial notebook for Machine Learners.

It is designed to approach the deep XML problem in the most simple way possible: predictors are simple and quick and embedding is approached with a linear projection ... but it works surprisingly well!

## Data
The data's been compiled for ease of use. It comes from [The 9th annual MLSP competition: New methods for acoustic classification of multiple simultaneous bird species in a noisy environment]( http://vintage.winklerbros.net/Publications/mlsp2013ma.pdf ) and will serve as a minimalistic XML example.

## Dependencies
 - scikit-learn
 - networkx
