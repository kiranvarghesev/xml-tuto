This is an eXtreme MultiLabel Classification tutorial notebook for Machine Learners.

It is designed to approach the deep XML problem in the most simple way possible: predictors are simple and quick and embedding is approached with a linear projection ... but it works surprisingly well! [See the notebook here ...](https://github.com/therhappy/xml-tuto/blob/master/eXtreme%20Multilabel%20Classification%20Notebook%20-%20EN.ipynb)

### New YouTube video!
If you want a quick look into XML, you can see my new video here:
[![Extreme MultiLabel Classification in Less than 5 minutes! (with movie genres)](https://i.imgur.com/BQPpRi8.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnAij5OSw5M "eXtreme MultiLabel Classification in less than 5 minutes (with movie genres!)")

## Data
The data's been compiled for ease of use. It comes from [The 9th annual MLSP competition: New methods for acoustic classification of multiple simultaneous bird species in a noisy environment]( http://vintage.winklerbros.net/Publications/mlsp2013ma.pdf ) and will serve as a minimalistic XML example.

## Dependencies
 - scikit-learn
 - networkx
